## Flaky Test

1. Flaky test is strange test that passes sometimes and fails sometimes.
2. If an element in a website using ajax to show the data, most likely i will use **WebDriverWait** combination with **ExpectedCondition**. We need to wait several times for ajax to show the data after do some action but we don't really know how much times ajax needs to complete it.
3. Firstly i'll ask for mock (or some header or flag) to bypass the captcha from backend-engineer. so i do not need to complete the captcha. The use of captcha basically for preventing computers to access or request automatically through the website. So, it's nearly impossible automating test that case hard-codely, as well as the captcha is failed if the automating test can run through it.
